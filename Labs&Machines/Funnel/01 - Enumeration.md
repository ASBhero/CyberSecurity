# Funnel Enumeration

## nmap

I initially ran the following command: Looks like we have 2 ports open. 

```bash
$ nmap funnel.htb

Nmap scan report for funnel.htb (10.129.228.195)
Host is up (0.24s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
22/tcp open  ssh
```


```bash
$ nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/funnel 10.0.0.1
Nmap scan report for funnel.htb (10.129.228.195)
Host is up (0.24s latency).

## FTP

The `nmap` gave me details on FTP anonymous login. 

```bash
$ ftp funnel.htb
Connected to funnel.htb.

```

The FTP has a directory named `mail_backup` . Under the dir, I found two files which I would like to deepdive.

Using `mget *` , I bulk downloaded the files.

Key findings:
- FTP allowed anonymous login using `anonymous` username. Password is blank
- The FTP had a directory called `mail_backup` and it contained two files.

## Deep dive retrieved files from [[01 - Enumeration#FTP]]

##### PDF contents

![[password_policy.png]]
The password policy pdf has the general guideline on creating a secure password. It also hints that the default password is ==`funnel123#!#`== .

##### Email Content

```bash
$ cat welcome_28112022

The welcome email was a copy of email which seems to be an onboarding email to new employees. This is good because its exposing the `To:` section and we can try to see if anyone in the group has forgotten to change their account password.
