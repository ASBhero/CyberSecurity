# Funnel Enumeration

## nmap

I initially ran the following command: Looks like we have 2 ports open. 

```bash
$ nmap funnel.htb

Nmap scan report for funnel.htb (10.129.228.195)
Host is up (0.24s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
22/tcp open  ssh
```


```bash
$ nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/funnel 10.0.0.1
Nmap scan report for funnel.htb (10.129.228.195)
Host is up (0.24s latency).

Key Findings:

## FTP

The `nmap` gave me details on FTP anonymous login. 

```bash
$ ftp funnel.htb
Connected to funnel.htb.

```

The FTP has a directory named `mail_backup` . Under the dir, I found two files which I would like to deepdive.

Using `mget *` , I bulk downloaded the files.

Key findings:
- FTP allowed anonymous login using `anonymous` username. Password is blank
- The FTP had a directory called `mail_backup` and it contained two files.

## Deep dive retrieved files from enumeration

##### PDF contents

![[password_policy.png]]
The password policy pdf has the general guideline on creating a secure password. It also hints that the default password is ==`funnel123#!#`== .

##### Email Content

```bash
$ cat welcome_28112022 
Frome: root@funnel.htb
To: optimus@funnel.htb albert@funnel.htb andreas@funnel.htb christine@funnel.htb maria@funnel.htb
Subject:Welcome to the team!

Hello everyone,
We would like to welcome you to our team. 
We think youâ€™ll be a great asset to the "Funnel" team and want to make sure you get settled in as smoothly as possible.
We have set up your accounts that you will need to access our internal infrastracture. Please, read through the attached password policy with extreme care.
All the steps mentioned there should be completed as soon as possible. If you have any questions or concerns feel free to reach directly to your manager. 
We hope that you will have an amazing time with us,
The funnel team. 
```

The welcome email was a copy of email which seems to be an onboarding email to new employees. This is good because its exposing the `To:` section and we can try to see if anyone in the group has forgotten to change their account password. 

- optimus
- albert
- andreas
- christine

## SSH Enumeration

Assuming that one of them forgot to change their password, I'm trying to access each user's machine by using the default ==funnel123#!#==  

```bash
$ ssh christine@funnel.htb
christine@funnel.htb\'s password:

Turns out it was `christine` who forgot to change her password.

## Deepdive in SSH user

Looking into `christine`'s machine, I could not find any `flag.txt` and no access to root directory. I tried `sudo -l` to see any commands I can run in `sudo` but turns out , it wasn't allowed

```bash
christine@funnel:/$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for christine: 
Sorry, user christine may not run sudo on funnel.
```

Since I have guided mode on , I checked the next question which gave me a big hint: **Which service is running on TCP port 5432** ...

## Enumerating nmap again
With the hint given by the guided mode, I once again ran the nmap for port 5432

```bash
$ nmap -p 5432 -sCV funnel.htb
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-06-12 01:39 BST
Nmap scan report for funnel.htb (10.129.228.195)
Host is up (0.25s latency).

PORT     STATE  SERVICE    VERSION
5432/tcp closed postgresql
```

Seems like we have a running `postgresql`

## postgresql enumeration and access

Accessing postgresql requires `psql` command, which the default parrot OS has.

```bash
$ psql -h funnel.htb
psql: error: could not connect to server: Connection refused
	Is the server running on host "funnel.htb" (10.129.228.195) and accepting
	TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
```

Unfortunately, the postgresql seems to be refusing the connection.
Looking into ( accidentally...) the guided mode, they are suggesting to check what `local port forwarding` and `reomte port forwardin` are. These seem to hint that we have to make `tunnel` to  access the postgresql machine. 

The resource I referred is [This one](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/ssh-port-forwarding#)and it gives you the definition of each tunneling as below.

```
There are three types of SSH port forwarding:

1. **Local port forwarding**: Redirects traffic from a local port on the client machine to a specified port on a remote server via an SSH connection.
2. **Remote port forwarding**: Redirects traffic from a port on the remote server to a specified port on the client machine.
3. **Dynamic port forwarding**: Creates a SOCKS proxy on the client machine, enabling the forwarding of traffic from various applications through the SSH connection.
```

For this case, we need to execute `Local Port Forwarding` as we are going to access the remote server ( target machine)
