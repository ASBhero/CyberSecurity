- The primary purpose of most types of security assessments is to find and confirm vulnerabilities are present, so we can work to patch, mitigate, or remove them
- All organizations must stay on top of both legacy and recent vulnerabilities and have a system for detecting and mitigating risks to their systems and data.

## Vulnerability Assessments
- A vulnerability assessment is based on a particular security standard, and compliance with these standards is analyzed (e.g., going through a checklist). It does not require technical expertise compares to other assessments such as `pentesting`
