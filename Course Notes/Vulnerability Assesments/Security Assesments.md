- The primary purpose of most types of security assessments is to find and confirm vulnerabilities are present, so we can work to patch, mitigate, or remove them
- All organizations must stay on top of both legacy and recent vulnerabilities and have a system for detecting and mitigating risks to their systems and data.

## Vulnerability Assessments
- A vulnerability assessment is based on a particular security standard, and compliance with these standards is analyzed (e.g., going through a checklist). It does not require technical expertise compares to other assessments such as `pentesting`

## Pentesting ( Penetration Testing
- A pentest is a type of simulated cyber attack, and pentesters conduct actions that a threat actor may perform to see if certain kinds of exploits are possible.

### Black Box 
- Black pentesting is done with no knowledge of a network's configuration or applications.
- This type of pentesting is usually conducted by third parties from the perspective of an `external` attacker.
### Grey Box
- Grey box pentesting is done with a little bit of knowledge of the network they're testing, from a perspective equivalent to an employee who doesn't work in the IT department, such as a receptionist or customer service agent.
- The customer will typically give the tester in-scope network ranges or individual IP addresses in a grey box situation.
### White Box
- Whit box pentesting is typically conducted by giving the penetration tester full access to all systems, configurations, build documents, etc., and source code if web applications are in-scope
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
### Difference between Pentesting and Vulnerability Assessment
