Understanding the methods by which threat actors
infiltrate networks and systems is essential for you
to assess the attack surface of your networks and
deploy controls to block attack vectors.

## Attack Surface and Threat Vectors

**Summary**

- **What is an attack surface?** The total sum of potential vulnerabilities and entry points a threat actor can use to compromise a system. This includes network ports, applications, devices, and even users themselves.
- **Why minimize it?** By reducing the attack surface, you limit the opportunities for exploitation, thereby strengthening your security posture.
- **How to assess it?** Consider the following:
    - **Scope:** Define the area you're analyzing (entire organization, single server, web app, etc.).
    - **Threat Actor:** Focus on the types of attackers most likely to target you (external, internal, etc.).
    - **Threat Vectors:** Identify the paths attackers could use to achieve their goals (data theft, disruption, etc.).

**Key Concepts**

- **Attack Surface:** The total set of points where an unauthorized user (attacker) can try to enter data to or extract data from a system.
- **Threat Actor:** An individual or group that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in a system.
- **Threat Vector:** The path or method used by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access to a system.
- **Attack Vector:** Sometimes used interchangeably with "threat vector," but can also refer specifically to a successfully exploited vulnerability.

## Vulnerable Software Vectors

**Summary**

- **Vulnerable Software:** Software with flaws that can be exploited to bypass security or crash the software. Due to the complexity and rapid development of software, vulnerabilities are common.
- **Impact:** Varies depending on the software affected. Can range from providing a foothold in the network to compromising cryptographic keys.
- **Unsupported Systems and Applications:** Software no longer receiving updates and patches from the vendor, making them highly vulnerable to exploits.
- **Isolation:** One strategy for dealing with unsupported applications is to isolate them to limit their exposure to potential threats. This is an example of a compensating control.
- **Scanning Software:** Tools used to identify and classify software vulnerabilities. Can be client-based (agent installed on each host) or agentless.

**Key Concepts**

- **Vulnerability:** A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat actor.
- **Patch:** A piece of software designed to update a program and fix security vulnerabilities.
- **Patch Management:** The process of identifying, acquiring, installing, and verifying patches for software.
- **Unsupported System:** A system that no longer receives updates or support from the vendor.
- **Compensating Control:** A security control that is put in place to mitigate a risk when a primary control cannot be implemented.
- **Client-Based Agent:** Software installed on a host that performs vulnerability scanning and reports to a management server.
- **Agentless Scanning:** A vulnerability scanning technique that does not require any software to be installed on the host.

## Network Vector

**Summary**

- **Exploit Techniques:** Exploiting software vulnerabilities can be done remotely (over a network) or locally (requiring authenticated access).
- **Unsecure Networks:** Networks lacking confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These become prime targets for threat actors.
- **Lack of Confidentiality:** Enables eavesdropping attacks, where attackers snoop on network traffic to steal sensitive information like passwords.
- **Lack of Integrity:** Allows on-path attacks, where attackers insert unauthorized devices to intercept, modify, or disrupt traffic.
- **Lack of Availability:** Opens the door to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, causing service disruptions.
- **Secure Networks:** Employ access control frameworks and cryptography to manage and protect network resources.
- **Threat Vectors in Unsecure Networks:**
    - Direct Access (physical access)
    - Wired Network (unauthorized devices)
    - Remote/Wireless Network (credential theft or protocol cracking)
    - Cloud Access (weak cloud credentials)
    - Bluetooth Network (malicious file transfer)
    - Default Credentials (unchanged default passwords)
    - Open Service Ports (unauthenticated connections)

**Key Concepts**

- **Remote Exploit:** A vulnerability that can be exploited over a network without authentication.
- **Local Exploit:** A vulnerability that requires authenticated access to the target system to exploit.
- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that information is only accessible to authorized individuals.
- **Integrity:** Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data. Â 
- **Availability:** Ensuring that systems and data are accessible when needed.
- **Access Control Framework:** A structure that dictates how subjects access objects.
- **Cryptography:** The practice of securing information using encryption.
- **Eavesdropping Attack:** An attack where an attacker intercepts and listens to network traffic.
- **On-Path Attack:** An attack where an attacker inserts a device into the network to intercept and modify traffic.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack:** An attack that aims to disrupt the availability of a service.
