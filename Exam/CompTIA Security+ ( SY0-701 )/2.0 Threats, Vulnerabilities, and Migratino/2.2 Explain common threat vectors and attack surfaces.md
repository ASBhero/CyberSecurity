Understanding the methods by which threat actors
infiltrate networks and systems is essential for you
to assess the attack surface of your networks and
deploy controls to block attack vectors.

## Attack Surface and Threat Vectors

- **What is an attack surface?** The total sum of potential vulnerabilities and entry points a threat actor can use to compromise a system. This includes network ports, applications, devices, and even users themselves.
- **Why minimize it?** By reducing the attack surface, you limit the opportunities for exploitation, thereby strengthening your security posture.
- **How to assess it?** Consider the following:
    - **Scope:** Define the area you're analyzing (entire organization, single server, web app, etc.).
    - **Threat Actor:** Focus on the types of attackers most likely to target you (external, internal, etc.).
    - **Threat Vectors:** Identify the paths attackers could use to achieve their goals (data theft, disruption, etc.).

**Key Concepts**

- **Attack Surface:** The total set of points where an unauthorized user (attacker) can try to enter data to or extract data from a system.
- **Threat Actor:** An individual or group that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in a system.
- **Threat Vector:** The path or method used by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access to a system.
- **Attack Vector:** Sometimes used interchangeably with "threat vector," but can also refer specifically to a successfully exploited vulnerability.
