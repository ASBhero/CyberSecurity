The preparation phase of incident response identifies data sources that
can support investigations. It also provisions tools to aggregate and
correlate this data and partially automate its analysis to drive an 
alerting and monitoring system. While automated detection is a huge 
support for the security team, it cannot identify all indicators of 
malicious activity. As an incident responder, you must be able to 
identify signs in data sources that point to a particular type of attack.

## Malware Classification

**Summary**

- **Malware:** Software designed to perform malicious actions on a system or network.
- **Malware Vectors:** The methods by which malware is delivered and executed on a system.
- **Types of Malware (Based on Vector):**
    - **Viruses:** Spread by infecting legitimate executable files.
    - **Worms:** Self-replicating malware that spreads independently, often over networks.
    - **Trojans:** Disguised as legitimate software, installed without user consent.
    - **Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs)/Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs):** Software installed alongside desired programs, often without explicit consent. Also known as grayware or bloatware.
- **Payload Classifications:**
    - **Spyware:** Gathers information about a user or organization without their knowledge.
    - **Rootkit:** Designed to hide its presence and maintain administrator-level access to a system.
    - **Remote Access Trojan (RAT):** Provides unauthorized remote access to a compromised system.
    - **Ransomware:** Encrypts files and demands a ransom for decryption.

## Computer Viruses

**Summarry**

A computer virus is a type of malware designed to replicate and spread by infecting executable applications or program code. There are several types of viruses based on the files or media they infect:

- **Non-resident/File Infector:** The virus is in a host executable file and infects other processes when the host runs.
- **Memory Resident:** The virus creates a process in memory when the host file is executed, staying active even if the host is terminated.
- **Boot:** The virus infects the disk boot sector or partition table and becomes active when the OS starts.
- **Script and Macro Viruses:** These use local scripting engines, such as PowerShell or JavaScript, or embedded code in documents like VBA in Microsoft Office files.
- **Multipartite:** These use multiple infection vectors.
- **Polymorphic:** These viruses change or obfuscate their code to evade detection.

All these viruses need a host file or media to spread, which can be distributed via disks, networks, email attachments, social media, or website downloads.

## Computer Worms and Filesless Malware

**Summary**

- **Worms vs. Viruses:**
    - Worms are self-replicating malware that spread independently over networks.
    - Viruses require user action (e.g., opening a file) to execute and spread.
- **Impact:**
    - Worms primarily consume network bandwidth, slowing down networks.
    - They can also cause system crashes (denial of service attacks) and carry malicious payloads.
- **Fileless Malware:**
    - Doesn't store its code on disk, making it harder to detect.
    - Often uses memory-resident techniques and legitimate system tools (like PowerShell and WMI) to operate.
    - Relies on obfuscation and on-the-fly compilation to evade detection.
- **Terminology:**
    - APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and AVT (Advanced Volatile Threat) are types of modern fileless malware.
    - LOC (Low-Observable Characteristics) attacks are another term for this type of threat.

**Key Concepts & Definitions:**

- **Computer Worm:** Self-replicating malware that can spread across networks without user intervention.
- **Virus:** Malware that requires user action to execute and spread.
- **Payload:** The malicious code carried by a worm or virus to perform harmful actions.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:** An attack that disrupts or crashes a system or network.
- **Fileless Malware:** Malware that doesn't store its code on disk, making it harder to detect.
- **Shellcode:** Small, self-contained code used by malware to establish a backdoor on a host.
- **Obfuscation:** The act of making code difficult to understand to evade detection.
- **Live off the Land:** A technique where malware uses legitimate system tools for malicious purposes.
- **PowerShell:** A powerful scripting language and command-line shell built into Windows.
- **WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation):** A set of tools for managing Windows systems.
- **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat):** A stealthy threat actor that maintains long-term access to a system.
- **AVT (Advanced Volatile Threat):** A threat actor that quickly exploits vulnerabilities for immediate gain.
- **LOC (Low-Observable Characteristics) Attack:** A stealthy attack designed to evade detection.

## Spyware and Keyloggers

 **Summary:**

- **Malware Evolution:**
    - Early viruses and worms focused on replication and destruction.
    - Modern malware increasingly targets user data for profit through intrusion, fraud, and theft.
- **Bloatware and Monitoring:**
    - Bloatware and malware employ various techniques to monitor users and collect data.
- **Tracking Cookies:**
    - Plaintext files that record web activity and collect user data when allowed by browser settings.
- **Supercookies and Beacons:**
    - Stealthy tracking mechanisms that are harder to detect and disable. Supercookies store tracking data in unconventional ways, while beacons use tiny images to track users.
- **Adware:**
    - A type of bloatware that modifies browser settings to enable tracking, display ads, and promote specific websites.
- **Spyware:**
    - Malware that tracks user activity, captures screenshots, records audio/video, and may redirect to malicious sites.
- **Keyloggers:**
    - Spyware designed to record keystrokes to steal sensitive information like passwords and credit card details.
    - Keyloggers can be implemented as software, hardware devices, or scripts.
- **Metasploit Meterpreter:**
    - A powerful remote access tool that can be used to capture keystrokes and other sensitive data.
