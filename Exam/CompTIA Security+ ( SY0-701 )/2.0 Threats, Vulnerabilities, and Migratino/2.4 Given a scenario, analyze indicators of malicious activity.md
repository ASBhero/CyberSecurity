The preparation phase of incident response identifies data sources that
can support investigations. It also provisions tools to aggregate and
correlate this data and partially automate its analysis to drive an 
alerting and monitoring system. While automated detection is a huge 
support for the security team, it cannot identify all indicators of 
malicious activity. As an incident responder, you must be able to 
identify signs in data sources that point to a particular type of attack.
