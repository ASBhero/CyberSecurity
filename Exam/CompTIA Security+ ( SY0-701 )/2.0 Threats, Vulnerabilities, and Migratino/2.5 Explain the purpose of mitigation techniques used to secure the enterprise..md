## ENDPOINT HARDENING

This text provides a detailed overview of operating system security. It highlights the importance of hardening, baselines, disabling unnecessary services, application service ports, and persistent storage for robust security. Additionally, it emphasizes the unique challenges of securing workstations and the importance of user-focused security strategies.

**Breaking down concepts and terms:**

- **Operating System Security:** Encompasses various practices to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and malware infections.
- **Hardening:** The process of changing an operating system or application to enhance its security.
- **Best Practice Baselines:** Standard guidelines for configuring devices securely.
- **Interfaces:** Connections to the network that should be disabled if not required.
- **Services:** Libraries of functions for applications; unused services should be disabled.
- **Application Service Ports:** Allow remote connections to applications and should be disabled or blocked if remote access is not required.
- **Persistent Storage:** Holds user data and cached credentials; disk encryption is crucial.
- **Workstations:** Operate at the frontline of an organization's activities and present unique challenges for endpoint hardening.
- **User-Focused Security Strategies:** Essential for securing workstations, including regular training and awareness activities.
- **Baseline Configuration:** A standard set of settings for different types of systems.
- **Registry Settings:** In Windows, configuration settings are stored in the registry.
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs):** On a Windows domain network, policy settings are applied to the registry via GPOs.
- **Baseline Deviation Reporting:** Testing the actual configuration of hosts to ensure compliance with the baseline template.
- **Security Compliance Toolkit:** Replaces older Microsoft tools for validating security configuration.
