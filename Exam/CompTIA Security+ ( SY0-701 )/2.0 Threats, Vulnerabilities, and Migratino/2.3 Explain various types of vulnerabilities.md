## Operating System Vulnerabilities

**Summary**

- **Operating System (OS) Vulnerabilities:** Flaws in an OS that can lead to significant security issues when exploited.
- **Microsoft Windows:** Large install base, making vulnerabilities widespread. Common issues include buffer overflows, input validation problems, and privilege flaws.
- **Apple macOS:** UNIX-based architecture, smaller user base than Windows. Vulnerabilities often found in access controls, secure boot processes, and third-party software.
- **Linux:** Prevalent server OS, open-source nature. Kernel vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and unpatched systems are common problems. Widespread use in the cloud and server infrastructure makes vulnerabilities significant.
- **Mobile OS (Android/iOS):** Increasingly popular targets due to widespread adoption. Android's open-source nature and fragmentation lead to inconsistent patching. iOS has also seen significant vulnerabilities.

**Key Concepts**

- **Operating System (OS):** The software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat actor.
- **Buffer Overflow:** An anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations. Â 
- **Input Validation:** The process of ensuring that any input to a system is valid and safe.
- **Privilege Flaw:** A vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on a system.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote system.
