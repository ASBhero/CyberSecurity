## 1.1 Compare and contrast various types of security controls.

### Security Control Categories

- Security Controls → A technology or procedure put in place to mitigate vulnerabilities and risk and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information.
    

- Managerial → oversight of the information system. 
    

- risk identification or a tool allowing the evaluation and selection of other security controls.
    

- Operational →  implementing operations primarily by people. 
    

- security guards and training programs
    

- Technical → a system (hardware, software, or firmware) control.
    

-  firewalls, antivirus software, and OS access control models are technical controls. 
    

- Physical → controls such as alarms, gateways, locks, lighting, and security cameras that deter and detect access to premises and hardware

### Security Control Functional Types

- Aside from the four Security Control Categories, security control can be also defined by goal, or function it performs
    

- Preventive →  to eliminate or reduce the likelihood that an attack can succeed. A preventive control operates before an attack can take place
    

- Access control lists (ACL) configured on firewalls and file system objects 
    
- Antimalware software acts as a preventive control by blocking malicious processes from executing. 
    

- Detective → identify and record an attempted or successful intrusion. A detective control operates during an attack.
    

-  Logs provide one of the best examples of detective-type controls.
    

- Corrective → eliminates or reduces the impact of a security policy violation. A corrective control is used after an attack. 
    

- backup system that restores data that was damaged during an intrusion. 
    
- patch management system that eliminates the vulnerability exploited during the attack.
    

- Directive → enforces a rule of behavior, such as a policy, best practice standard, or standard operating procedure (SOP). 
    

- employee's contract will set out disciplinary procedures or causes for dismissal if they do not comply with policies and procedures. 
    
- Training and awareness programs can also be considered as directive controls.
    

- Deterrent → may not physically or logically prevent access, but it psychologically discourages an attacker from attempting an intrusion.
    

- warnings of legal penalties against trespass or intrusion.
    

- Compensating → a substitute for a principal control, as recommended by a security standard, and affords the same (or better) level of protection but uses a different methodology or technology.

### Information Security Roles and Responsibilities

- In order to adopt an effective organisational security posture, employees should understand their responsibilities. Organisation should also understand the roles they must appoint
    

- Chief Information Officer (CIO) → role who takes overall responsibility for IT function
    
- Chief Technology Officer (CTO) → role who is more focused on implementing and using new technology effectively
    
- Chief Security Officer (CSO) → In larger organisations , it is typical to appoint an officer specialised in security. 
    
- Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) → role specifically focused on implementing , maintaining and monitoring security policies
    

  

### Information Security Competencies

- IT professionals in the world of security must wear different hats and must be competent in below activities
    

- Participate in risk assessment and testing security systems
    
- install, and configure secure devices and software
    
- Set up and maintain document access control and user privilege profiles.
    
- Monitor audit logs, review user privilege 
    
- Manage security related incidents
    
- Create and test business continuity plan 
    
- Participate in Security trainings and education programmes
    

  

### Information Security Business Unit

- Security Operation Centre (SOC) →  a location where security professionals monitor and protect critical information assets across other business functions, Due to cost, SOC is usually employed by large corporations, like a government agency or a healthcare company. 
    
- Development and Security Operations (DevSecOps) → A combination of software development, security operations, and systems operations, and refers to the practice of integrating each discipline with the others.
    
- Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) →  a single point of contact for the notification of security incidents. This function might be handled by the SOC 
    

  
  

## 1.2 Summarize fundamental security concepts

### Information Security

- Information Security ( infosec in short ) → protection of data resources from unauthorised access, attack, theft, or damage.
    
- Secure information has three properties, often referred to as the CIA Triad: 
    

- Confidentiality → information can only be read by people who have been explicitly authorised to access it.
    
- Integrity → data is stored and transferred as intended and that any modification is authorised
    
- Availability → information is readily accessible to those authorised to view or modify it. 
    

- The idea of Non-Repudiation is also crucial in the world of security
    

- Non-Repudiation → a person cannot deny doing something, such as creating, modifying, or sending a resource
    

  

### Cybersecurity Framework

- cybersecurity refers specifically to provisioning secure processing hardware and software
    
- cybersecurity tasks can be classified as five functions, following the framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/getting-started/online-learning/five-functions]
    

- Identify → Evaluate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.
    
- Protect → procure/develop, install, operate, and decommission IT hardware and software assets with security as an embedded requirement of every stage of this operation's lifecycle.
    
- Detect → proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.
    
- Respond → identify, analyse, contain, and eradicate threats
    
- Recover → implement cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.
    

- A cybersecurity framework guides the selection and configuration of controls. 
    

- Frameworks are important because they save an organisation from building its security program in a vacuum, or from building the program on a foundation that fails to account for important security concepts.
    
- The use of a framework allows an organisation to make an objective statement of its current cybersecurity capabilities, identify a target level of capability, and prioritise investments to achieve that target.

### Gap Analysis

- Gap Analysis → a process that identifies how an organisation's security systems deviate from those required or recommended by a framework. 
    

- performed when first adopting a framework or when meeting a new industry or legal compliance requirement. 
    
- Gap analysis might be repeated every few years to meet compliance requirements or to validate any changes that have been made to the framework.

### Access Control

- access control → ensure an information system meets the goals of the CIA triad. 
    

- Access control governs how subjects/principals may interact with objects. 
    

- Subjects → people, devices,  software processes, or any other system that can request and be granted access to a resource. 
    
- Objects → the resources. Objects could be a network, server, database, app, or file. Subjects are assigned rights or permissions on resources.
    

- Identity and Access Management ( IAM for short ) → A security process that provides identification, authentication, and authorization mechanisms for users, computers, and other entities to work with organisational assets like networks, operating systems, and applications.
    

- Identification → creating an account or ID that uniquely represents the user, device, or process on the network. 
    
- Authentication → proving that a subject is who or what it claims to be when it attempts to access the resource. 
    

- people might be authenticated by providing a password; 
    
- a computer system could be authenticated using a token such as a digital certificate.
    

- Authorization → determining what rights subjects should have on each resource, and enforcing those rights. 
    
- Accounting → tracking authorised usage of a resource or use of rights by a subject and alerting when unauthorised use is detected or attempted.

### Zero Trust 

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXch32F_GlvnMYPtkCvYLKR8s4eyU-PcNU3dQqRpHwQ_BfqCGNrws1CPa17BBG39Ug254qtxn4fWrDBBIMJIfrRhpiZ9QbDwfMs405saQe7DqkPZq4NQxVDTKMaAXORzL3G0q_iKhqi2NIf6zuEwL_oQW_--?key=9a5-3sW0xAJDxFQ-9ELx2g)

#### Zero Trust Security Model:

The zero trust security model is built on the idea that nothing is inherently trusted within a network. Instead, every access request, whether from inside or outside the network perimeter, is thoroughly verified. Key concepts within this model include:

- Adaptive Identity: Identity verification is ongoing and adapts based on a user's current context and resources they need.
    
- Threat Scope Reduction: Access is granted on a need-to-know basis to minimize potential damage from attacks.
    
- Policy-Driven Access Control: Strict policies, considering user identity, device health, and network context, govern who can access what.
    

#### Control Plane

The control plane is the brains of the zero-trust architecture. It houses the Policy Decision Point (PDP), which is the central authority for making access decisions.

1. Policy Engine: This is the core of the PDP. It's like a powerful computer that analyzes a vast amount of information. It looks at:
    

- Subject and host identities and credentials: Who is trying to access the resource and what device are they using?
    
- Access control policies: What are the rules about who can access what?
    
- Threat intelligence: Are there any known threats related to this access request?
    
- Behavioral analytics: Is the user behaving normally or is their behavior suspicious?
    
- Host and network security scanning and monitoring results: Is the device and the network it's on secure?
    

3. Using all this data, the policy engine determines whether or not to allow access.
    
4. Policy Administrator: Once the policy engine makes a decision, the policy administrator takes action. It communicates with the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) in the data plane to either:
    

- Issue an access token and establish a secure session if access is granted.
    
- Deny access or terminate an existing session if access is denied or revoked.
    

#### Data Plane

The data plane is where the actual communication happens. It's the highway where data travels between subjects (users or services) and resources (applications or servers).

1. Subjects: These are the entities requesting access to resources. They could be human users or automated services.
    
2. Systems: These are the devices that subjects use to access resources, like laptops, smartphones, or servers.
    
3. Resources: These are the applications or data that subjects want to access.
    
4. Policy Enforcement Point (PEP): The PEP is like a traffic cop on the data highway. It sits between the subject and the resource and enforces the access decisions made by the policy engine in the control plane. If access is granted, the PEP establishes a secure connection, often in the form of an implicit trust zone, which is a temporary, encrypted tunnel for data transfer.
    

#### Key Points

- The separation of the control plane and data plane is essential in Zero Trust. It allows for centralized policy management and enforcement, making it easier to maintain security and adapt to changing threats.
    
- The policy engine is the heart of the control plane, making intelligent access decisions based on a wide range of factors.
    
- The PEP is the enforcer in the data plane, carrying out the decisions made by the policy engine.
    
- Implicit trust zones are temporary, secure connections that are established for specific transactions, minimizing the attack surface.
    

### Physical Security 

- Foundation of Protection: Physical security is the first and most fundamental layer of defense in cybersecurity.
    
- Asset Protection: It safeguards the physical components (servers, data centers, etc.) housing critical digital data.
    
- Diverse Measures: This includes access controls, surveillance systems, and environmental controls in sensitive areas.
    
- Technical Security Parallels: Physical access controls share principles with technical security:
    

- Authentication (verifying identity)
    
- Authorization (controlling access points)
    
- Accounting (tracking access)
    

- Zoning Strategy: Often involves creating zones with increasingly restrictive security measures as one progresses inward.  
      
    

#### Site layout, Fencing and lighting

Physical security through environmental design uses the built environment to deter and prevent crime. This approach involves strategically designing buildings, landscapes, and public spaces to incorporate non-obvious security features. By doing so, organizations can enhance security, discourage criminal activity, and create a safer environment for everyone. This approach is often cost-effective and can be implemented in both new and existing structures.

- Barricades and Entry/Exit Points: Control access, funnel people through specific areas, and use authentication mechanisms.
    
- Fencing: Transparent, robust barriers to deter intruders.
    
- Lighting: Improves visibility, deters crime, and enhances surveillance.
    
- Bollards: Physical barriers that prevent vehicle access to restricted areas.
    
- Existing Structures: Strategically locate secure zones, use signage, control traffic flow, and enhance visibility in public areas.
    

### Deception and disruption Technology 

Deception and disruption technologies are active cybersecurity defense mechanisms that make attacks more challenging and costly for malicious actors. They use decoy systems, networks, and data to distract and analyze attackers, ultimately enhancing an organization's security posture.

#### Deception Technologies:

- Honeypot: A decoy system designed to mimic real targets and lure attackers. It helps gather information about attack methods and tools.
    
- Honeynet: A network of interconnected honeypots, simulating a larger, more complex environment to deceive and monitor attackers.
    
- Honeyfile: A fake file appearing to contain valuable information, used to detect unauthorized access attempts.
    
- Honeytoken: False credentials or data used to trigger alerts and track attacker behavior.
    

#### Disruption Technologies:

- Bogus DNS entries: False DNS records leading to non-existent hosts, wasting attackers' time and resources.
    
- Decoy web directories/pages: Dynamically generated or misleading web content to confuse automated scanning tools.
    
- Port triggering/spoofing: Manipulating responses to port scans to mislead attackers about open ports.
    
- DNS sinkhole: Redirecting suspicious traffic to a controlled environment (like a honeynet) for analysis.
    

## 1.3 Explain the importance of change management processes and the impact to security.

### Change Management Program

Change management is a structured process that governs how modifications, big or small, are introduced to an organization's systems, products, or services. It's a critical discipline that ensures changes are made in a controlled and coordinated manner, minimizing negative impacts and maximizing positive outcomes.

The change management process typically includes the following stages:

1. Request: Someone identifies a need for change and submits a formal request.
    
2. Assessment: The change is evaluated for its feasibility, potential impact, and alignment with business goals.
    
3. Approval: Key stakeholders review and approve the change before it's implemented.
    
4. Implementation: The change is carefully rolled out, often during a pre-planned maintenance window.
    
5. Review: After implementation, the change is reviewed to ensure it has achieved its intended results.
    

Change management is not just about IT. It affects everyone in the organization, from end-users who need to be trained on new systems to executives who need to understand the business impact of the change. Effective change management requires collaboration and communication across all levels of the organization.

By prioritizing change management, organizations can embrace change as an opportunity for growth and innovation, rather than a source of risk and disruption.

### Allowed and Blocked Changes

Allow lists and deny lists are tools used in change management to control what changes are permitted or prohibited. In the context of change management, these lists can refer to types of changes, software, hardware, or even individuals. Allow lists streamline processes for pre-approved, low-risk changes, while deny lists act as a safeguard against unauthorized or risky modifications.

- Allow List (Whitelist):
    

- In change management: A list of pre-approved changes, software, hardware, or individuals that are not subject to the full change management process.
    
- In technical controls: A list of entities (e.g., IP addresses, applications) explicitly allowed to access a system or network.
    

- Deny List (Blacklist):
    

- In change management: A list of prohibited changes, software, hardware, or individuals that are blocked from being implemented or must go through a strict change management process.
    
- In technical controls: A list of entities explicitly denied access to a system or network.

### Restarts, Dependencies, and Downtime

Service and application restarts, along with potential downtime, are crucial considerations in change management. They directly impact business operations, so minimizing disruptions is a primary goal. Understanding dependencies between systems, developing backout plans, and carefully planning downtime contingencies are essential for successful change implementation. Legacy systems pose unique challenges due to outdated technology, limited documentation, and lack of vendor support, requiring special attention during change management.

- Service/Application Restart: The process of stopping and restarting a service or application to apply changes or resolve issues.
    
- Downtime: The period during which a service or application is unavailable, either planned (scheduled downtime) or unplanned (unscheduled downtime).
    
- Maintenance Window: A predefined time period for implementing changes to minimize disruption.
    
- Dependencies: The relationships between systems or applications where one relies on another to function correctly.
    
- Backout Plan: A contingency plan to reverse changes if implementation fails.
    
- Legacy System: An outdated computer system or application still in use, often with limited support and documentation.
    

### Documentation and Version Control

version control and change management are crucial in maintaining accurate documentation and ensuring smooth transitions when changes are made to systems or applications. It highlights the different types of documentation that are typically affected by change management and emphasizes the need for regular updates to keep these documents current and relevant.

Version Control: The practice of tracking and managing changes to documents or code to maintain a history of revisions, ensure authorized modifications, and enable easy rollback to previous versions if needed.

Change Management: A structured approach to implementing changes to systems or applications, including assessing impacts, developing plans, conducting testing, and updating relevant documentation and training materials.

Documentation Types: The text mentions several types of documentation affected by change management:

- Change requests
    
- Policies and procedures
    
- System/process documentation
    
- Configuration management documentation
    
- Training materials
    
- Incident response and recovery plans
    

## 1.4 Explain the importance of using appropriate cryptographic solutions.

#### Cryptographic Concept

Cryptography is the practice of securing information by converting it into a secret code (ciphertext). This is in direct contrast to "security through obscurity," which relies on hiding the information, a method that is often unreliable, especially in computer systems. Cryptography ensures that even if the existence and location of the secret are known, the information remains unintelligible without the correct decoding method.

Key terminology in cryptography includes:

- Plaintext: The original, unencrypted message.
    
- Ciphertext: The encrypted, unreadable message.
    
- Algorithm: The procedure used to encrypt and decrypt the message.
    
- Cryptanalysis: The process of attempting to break cryptographic systems.
    

there are three main types of cryptographic algorithms, each with a role in ensuring security properties like confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation:

- Hashing algorithms
    
- Symmetric encryption ciphers
    
- Asymmetric encryption ciphers
    

#### Symmetric Encryption

Encryption algorithms, or ciphers, transform data into a secure format (ciphertext) using a key. Only those with the correct key can decrypt and access the original information.

Substitution and Transposition Algorithms

These are fundamental building blocks of encryption:

- Substitution: Replaces characters or blocks of text with different ones (e.g., ROT13).
    
- Transposition: Rearranges the order of characters or blocks without altering them.
    

Modern algorithms combine these techniques in complex ways to resist cryptanalysis (code-breaking).

Symmetric Algorithms

Symmetric algorithms use the same secret key for both encryption and decryption. This method is fast and efficient for large amounts of data.

Key Exchange Challenge

The main weakness of symmetric encryption is securely exchanging the key between parties. If an attacker (Mallory) intercepts the key, the confidentiality of the data is compromised.

Limitations of Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption does not provide authentication or integrity. Since both parties use the same key, either could have created the ciphertext, and the message's contents could be altered without detection.

  

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfGpkI2DuAzPF8iDIybo3_uqXNEU16Y3Twtqu5ZrhlblHddKrKmSkgpF8zGDGMs_h0dm9SlhkQU0HDVA_Tw8IM3ZPrB-_Mo_VDhsgU31tX9MVVWsTVHoxjstWFyOfC1C43gwZ_aJE9brCSx-SKzr_Jz1KX-?key=9a5-3sW0xAJDxFQ-9ELx2g)

#### Key Length

Encryption algorithms use keys to add a layer of security. A key is a value that modifies the encryption process, ensuring that even if the encryption method is known, the ciphertext remains unreadable without the correct key.

Keyspace and Brute Force Attacks

The keyspace refers to the range of possible key values. Larger keyspaces offer more security as they make brute force attacks (trying all possible key combinations) impractical due to the vast number of possibilities.

Key Length and Strength

Modern symmetric ciphers use keys with a specific length, measured in bits. The number of bits determines the keyspace and thus the algorithm's resistance to brute force attacks. For example, AES-128 has 2^128 possible key values, while AES-256 has 2^256, a vastly larger keyspace.

Trade-offs of Larger Keys

While larger keys enhance security, they also require more computational resources (memory and processing power) for encryption and decryption operations.

#### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption utilizes two distinct but related keys: a public key (shared openly) and a private key (kept secret). A message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key. This property allows for secure communication without the need for a pre-shared secret key.

Key Exchange Process:

1. Bob generates a key pair and keeps the private key confidential.
    
2. Bob shares the public key with Alice.
    
3. Alice encrypts her message using Bob's public key.
    
4. Alice sends the encrypted message to Bob.
    
5. Bob decrypts the message using his private key.
    

Even if Mallory intercepts the encrypted message and the public key, she cannot decrypt it without Bob's private key.

Asymmetric Algorithms and Key Lengths:

Several algorithms implement asymmetric encryption:

- RSA: Requires a 2048-bit private key for adequate security.
    
- ECC: Offers similar security to RSA with shorter 256-bit keys.
    

#### Hashing

Cryptographic hashing algorithms transform input data (plaintext) into a fixed-length string of bits called a hash or message digest. This process is one-way (irreversible), meaning you cannot recover the original data from the hash. Additionally, different inputs are highly unlikely to produce the same hash (collision resistance).

Proving Integrity with Hashing:

Hashing is primarily used to verify the integrity of data. For example:

1. Password Verification: Instead of storing plain text passwords, systems store their hashes. When a user logs in, the entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash. A match confirms the correct password without revealing it.
    
2. File Integrity Verification: The hash of a file is published alongside it. After downloading, the user can calculate the hash of the downloaded file and compare it to the published one. A match indicates the file has not been tampered with during transmission.
    

Hash Algorithm Implementations:

- SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm): Considered the most robust, with variants like SHA256 producing 256-bit digests.
    
- MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5): Produces 128-bit digests. While not as secure as SHA256, it might be needed for compatibility with older systems.
    

Important Note: Even if an attacker replaces a file, they cannot easily change the published hash to match the altered file. Any mismatch indicates a compromised file.

#### Digital Signature

A cryptographic primitive is a fundamental component such as a hash function, symmetric cipher, or asymmetric cipher. Cryptographic systems often combine these primitives within a cipher suite to achieve various security goals. Encryption ensures confidentiality, while cryptographic ciphers also provide integrity and authentication.

Public key cryptography authenticates the sender by using a private key, while hashing ensures message integrity. These methods can be combined to create digital signatures, which authenticate messages and ensure data integrity during transmission.

The process of using digital signatures involves the sender creating a hash of the message, signing it with their private key, and sending both the message and the signature to the recipient. The recipient then verifies the signature with the sender’s public key and compares the hash to ensure the message has not been tampered with.

There are several standards for creating digital signatures, including PKCS#1 for RSA, DSA using ElGamal, and the widely used ECDSA developed under US government standards.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfRZnTmY_3nYebg-Lan_wEnpAcEn7-PapQdvtM5bdDmdYHkz_iatIzjpP6qUSaH6FYNVQm0wTP3z5zkVNnUA070nuUiN1khA3UIcMpvyXGkUwwVu2uDvzXty0qLDnvd4BDZbEPZ7IZn804Bz6Y98iVnADnz?key=9a5-3sW0xAJDxFQ-9ELx2g)

#### Certificate Authorities

Public key cryptography (PKI) is a system designed to enhance the security and trustworthiness of digital communications. It addresses the core challenge of how to verify the identity of the owner of a public key. This is particularly crucial in e-commerce and other online transactions where the authenticity of the parties involved is paramount.

PKI achieves this verification through digital certificates. When an entity wants to establish trust, it creates a digital certificate that contains its public key. This certificate is then signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), which acts as a trusted third party. The CA's signature on the certificate essentially vouches for the identity of the certificate holder, asserting that the public key genuinely belongs to the entity it claims to represent.

There are two main types of CAs: private and third-party. Private CAs are typically used within organizations for internal communications, while third-party CAs are used for public and business-to-business communications. Reputable third-party CAs, such as Comodo, DigiCert, and others, play a crucial role in establishing trust across the internet.

The functions of a third-party CA are comprehensive and essential. They offer a range of certificate services, ensuring the validity of certificates and verifying the identity of applicants. They also work to build trust with users, governments, and businesses.

#### Digital Certificates

A digital certificate is a structured digital document that securely houses a subject's public key. It acts as a verifiable container of information, including not only the public key itself but also details about the entity the certificate is issued to (the subject) and the issuing authority (the Certificate Authority, or CA). The certificate's authenticity and integrity are ensured through a digital signature, which cryptographically confirms that the CA issued it to the intended subject. The subject can be a person, such as in the case of certificates used for signing email messages, or a machine, like a web server facilitating secure online transactions.

  

These digital certificates adhere to the X.509 standard, a widely recognized format established by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Additionally, RSA, a leading cybersecurity company, has developed a set of standards known as Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS), which further promote the adoption and use of public key infrastructure, the framework within which digital certificates operate.

#### Root of Trust

The root of trust model establishes how users and Certificate Authorities (CAs) trust each other within a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The foundation of this model is the root certificate, a self-signed certificate issued by the CA to itself. This root certificate, typically using a strong RSA or ECC key, acts as the ultimate trust anchor.

Different CA Models

1. Single CA Model: A single root CA issues certificates directly to end users and devices. This model is often used in private networks but is vulnerable if the CA is compromised.
    
2. Hierarchical Model (Third-Party CAs): A root CA issues certificates to intermediate CAs, which then issue certificates to end entities (leaf certificates). This model offers flexibility, scalability, and better trust management.
    
3. Self-Signed Certificates: Used when traditional PKI is too complex or costly. Often found in development, testing, or consumer-grade devices. These certificates lack external validation and should not be used for critical systems.

#### Certificate Signing Requests

1. Registration with the CA:
    

- End-users initiate the process by registering an account with a Certificate Authority (CA).
    
- The CA's specific procedures for user authorization and identity verification vary based on their implementation.
    
- For instance, in a Windows domain network, users and devices often auto-enroll by simply authenticating to Active Directory.
    
- Third-party CAs might employ a range of verification methods to ensure the legitimacy of the user's identity.
    
- The CA prioritizes verifying the legitimacy of users to maintain its reputation.
    

3. Certificate Request Preparation:
    

- The user generates a key pair, consisting of a private and public key, using a chosen cipher (e.g., RSA or ECC) and key length.
    
- The private key must be kept confidential and known solely by the user.
    
- The user fills out a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and submits it to the CA.
    
- The CSR includes the information the user wants in the certificate, such as their public key.
    

5. CA Review and Approval:
    

- The CA reviews the CSR, verifying the validity of the provided information.
    
- For a web server, this might involve confirming that the subject name matches the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and that the CSR was initiated by the person authorized to manage the domain.
    
- If the request meets the CA's requirements, they sign the certificate and send it to the user.

Explanation of Key Concepts and Terms

- Certificate Authority (CA): A trusted entity that issues digital certificates.
    
- Registration: The process by which users create an account with a CA to request certificates.
    
- Key Pair: A set of cryptographic keys, one private and one public, used for secure communication.
    
- Private Key: A secret key used for decryption and digital signatures, kept confidential by the user.
    
- Public Key: A key openly shared with others, used for encryption and verification of digital signatures.
    
- Certificate Signing Request (CSR): A formal request from a user to a CA for a digital certificate, containing the user's public key and other identifying information.
    
- Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): The complete domain name for a specific website or server, including all levels of the domain hierarchy.
    

#### Subject Name Attributes

  

Common Name (CN) vs. Subject Alternative Name (SAN):

- CN (Deprecated): Historically used to identify the server's FQDN, but now considered less reliable due to potential misinterpretation by browsers.
    
- SAN (Preferred): Specifically designed to represent various identifiers (FQDNs, IP addresses), offering better validation. Browsers should prioritize SAN over CN if present.
    

SAN Best Practices:

- Multiple Domains/Subdomains: The SAN field allows a single certificate to cover multiple subdomains (e.g., www.comptia.org and members.comptia.org) or even different top-level domains.
    
- Wildcard Domains: A wildcard character (*) in the SAN field covers all subdomains to a single level (e.g., *.comptia.org).
    

Additional Certificate Fields:

- Organization (O): The legal name of the organization associated with the certificate.
    
- Organizational Unit (OU): The department within the organization responsible for the certificate.
    
- Locality (L): The city or town where the organization is located.
    
- State (ST): The state or province where the organization is located.
    
- Country (C): The two-letter country code where the organization is located.
    

Distinguished Name (DN):

- A concatenation of CN, O, OU, L, ST, and C fields, forming a unique identifier for the certificate subject.
    

Certificate Types Beyond Server Identification:

- Email Certificates: Used for user accounts, with the SAN field representing an RFC 822 email address.
    
- Code-Signing Certificates: Verify the authenticity of software publishers or developers, focusing on validating organization and locale details rather than SAN.
    

#### Certificate Revocation 

Revocation vs. Suspension:

- Revoked Certificate: A certificate that is permanently invalidated and cannot be reinstated.
    
- Suspended Certificate: A certificate that is temporarily invalidated but can be re-enabled.
    

Reasons for Revocation or Suspension:

- Key compromise
    
- Business closure
    
- User leaving the company
    
- Domain name change
    
- Certificate misuse
    
- Other specified reasons
    

Certificate Revocation List (CRL):

- A list maintained by the CA of all revoked and suspended certificates.
    
- Contains information such as publish period, distribution points, validity period, and signature.
    
- Accessible to anyone relying on the CA's certificates.
    

CRL Limitations:

- Risk of accepting revoked certificates before the CRL is updated.
    
- Some legacy software may not be configured to perform CRL checking.
    

Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):

- An alternative method for checking certificate status in real-time.
    
- Details of the OCSP responder service are usually included in the certificate.
    
- Most OCSP servers can directly query the certificate database for real-time status.
    

#### Key Management

Key management encompasses the operational procedures involved in the various stages of a cryptographic key's lifecycle. The key lifecycle typically includes the following stages:

- Key Generation:
    

- The process of creating either an asymmetric key pair (public and private keys) or a symmetric secret key.
    
- Key strength and cipher choice are crucial considerations during this stage.
    

- Storage:
    

- Safeguarding private or secret keys from unauthorized access, loss, or damage.
    
- Employing secure storage mechanisms like hardware security modules (HSMs) or encrypted key stores is essential.
    

- Revocation:
    

- In the event of a key compromise, revocation renders the key invalid and unusable.
    
- Re-encryption of data previously encrypted with the compromised key is necessary.
    

- Expiration and Renewal:
    

- Setting an expiration date for a key enhances security by limiting its lifespan.
    
- Keys can be renewed upon expiration, either by reusing the existing key pair or generating a new one.
    

- Decentralized vs. Centralized Key Management:
    

- Decentralized: Keys are generated and managed directly on the device or user account using the certificate. This approach is easy to deploy but can make key compromise detection difficult.
    
- Centralized: Keys are generated and stored on a dedicated server or appliance, typically using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) for communication with other devices and applications.
    

#### Key Escrow

Key Loss and Damage:

- Losing or damaging a private or secret key can result in the irreversible loss of access to encrypted data.
    
- Creating multiple copies of a key increases the risk of compromise and makes detection more challenging.
    

Mitigation Strategies:

- Escrow:
    

- Involves storing a copy (or parts) of a key with a trusted third party.
    
- Reduces the risk of total key loss and enables recovery in case of emergencies.
    

- M of N Control:
    

- Requires a quorum (M) of authorized individuals (N) to agree before a key can be accessed or used.
    
- Enhances security by preventing a single person from having complete control over a key.
    

Key Recovery Process:

- Key Splitting:
    

- A key can be divided into multiple parts, each held by a different escrow provider.
    
- This minimizes the risk of a single point of compromise.
    

- Key Recovery Agent (KRA):
    

- An individual or entity authorized to access a key held in escrow.
    
- Recovery policies often require multiple KRAs to authorize key access, mitigating the risk of impersonation.
    

#### Encryption Supporting Confidentiality

  

Encryption and Data Security:

- Encryption plays a crucial role in safeguarding data confidentiality by rendering it unreadable to unauthorized parties.
    
- This protection applies to data at rest, in transit, and in use.
    

Three States of Data:

- Data at Rest: Data stored on persistent storage media like hard drives, SSDs, or USB drives.
    
- Data in Transit (Data in Motion): Data transmitted over a network, such as emails, website traffic, or file transfers.
    
- Data in Use (Data in Processing): Data actively being processed in volatile memory like RAM, CPU registers, or cache.
    

Bulk Encryption:

- Symmetric Encryption (e.g., AES): Preferred for encrypting large amounts of data (megabytes or gigabytes) due to its speed and efficiency.
    
- Asymmetric Encryption (e.g., RSA, ECC): Not ideal for bulk encryption due to computational overhead and slower processing speeds.
    
- Hybrid Approach: Most systems utilize a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption:
    

- Key Encryption Key (KEK): An asymmetric key pair used to encrypt the Data Encryption Key (DEK).
    
- Data Encryption Key (DEK): A symmetric key used to encrypt the actual data.
    
- Process: The DEK is encrypted with the KEK's public key, and the user's private key (protected by credentials) is required to decrypt the DEK to access the data.
    

#### Disk and File Encryption

  

Data at rest encryption encompasses various storage mechanisms, each offering different levels of security and flexibility:

1. Full Disk Encryption (FDE):

- Encrypts the entire contents of a storage device, including metadata and free space.
    
- Primarily protects against physical theft of the disk.
    
- Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) are hardware-based FDE solutions.
    

2. Partition Encryption:

- Encrypts specific partitions on a storage device, allowing for selective protection of different data types.
    
- Partitions can be encrypted using different keys, offering flexibility.
    

3. Volume Encryption:

- Encrypts a storage resource with a single file system (e.g., a removable disk, HDD/SSD partition, or RAID array).
    
- Often implemented as software applications (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault).
    
- May or may not encrypt free space and/or file metadata.
    

4. File Encryption:

- Encrypts individual files or folders.
    
- Requires file system support (e.g., EFS works with NTFS).
    

Additional Considerations:

- Metadata: Metadata can reveal information about files and should be considered for encryption.
    
- Free Space: Unallocated space may contain remnants of deleted files and could be a security risk.
    
- TPM/HSM: If available, these hardware modules can securely store encryption keys for enhanced protection.
    

#### Database Encryption

Database encryption aims to protect sensitive data stored in structured databases. This is particularly important due to the often confidential or personal nature of data stored in databases. Here's how it works:

1. Database Structure:
    

- Data is organized in tables with rows (records) and columns (fields).
    
- Tables are stored as files on a volume, accessed through a Database Management System (DBMS) using a language like SQL.
    

3. Encryption Levels:
    

- Disk/Volume Encryption: Basic protection against theft of the storage media, but can impact performance.
    
- DBMS/Plugin Encryption: More commonly used, offering different levels of granularity:
    

5. Database-Level Encryption (Transparent Data Encryption - TDE):
    

- Encrypts all data transferred between disk and memory.
    
- Protects data at rest and in transit within the database system.
    

7. Record-Level Encryption:
    

- Protects individual records using separate keys.
    
- Offers granular control over data access, especially for sensitive information.
    
- Cell/Column Encryption: Encrypts specific fields within a table.
    

9. Cell/Column Encryption (Always Encrypted):
    

- Data remains encrypted in memory and is only decrypted when the client application provides the key.
    
- Enhances privacy by separating duties between database administrators and data owners.
    

11. Record-Level Encryption Example (Health Insurer):
    

- Each customer's data is encrypted with a unique key pair, ensuring fine-grained access control and compliance with privacy regulations.
    

#### Transport Encryption and Key Exchange

Transport encryption secures data while it's being transmitted over a network, safeguarding it from unauthorized access. Various encryption products exist for different network solutions:

Types of Transport Encryption:

- Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA): Secures traffic on wireless networks.
    
- Internet Protocol Security (IPsec): Creates Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to secure traffic between endpoints over untrusted networks.
    
- Transport Layer Security (TLS): Protects application data (e.g., web, email) over public networks.
    

Key Exchange and Encryption Process:

1. Obtain Public Key: The sender (Alice) gets the recipient's (Bob) public key, usually from a digital certificate.
    
2. Encrypt Message: Alice encrypts the message using a symmetric session key (e.g., AES).
    
3. Encrypt Session Key: Alice encrypts the session key with Bob's public key.
    
4. Digital Envelope: The encrypted session key is attached to the ciphertext in a digital envelope and sent to Bob.
    
5. Decrypt Session Key: Bob uses his private key to decrypt the session key.
    
6. Decrypt Message: Bob uses the decrypted session key to decrypt the message.
    

Integrity and Authenticity:

- Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC): Combines the session key with a message hash to ensure integrity and authenticity.
    
- Authenticated Encryption (AE): A symmetric cipher mode that provides both confidentiality and integrity/authenticity.

#### Perfect Forward Secrecy 

Digital Envelope Basics:

- Parties exchange or agree on a secret key for symmetric encryption.
    
- Original method involved server and client exchanging keys protected by the server's key pair.
    
- Vulnerability: If server's private key is compromised, recorded session data can be decrypted.
    

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):

- Mitigates the risk of basic key exchange.
    
- Uses Diffie-Hellman (D-H) key agreement to create ephemeral session keys without the server's private key.
    
- Enables Alice and Bob to derive the same shared secret by sharing some values while keeping others private.
    
- Authenticity of server-sent values is proven using a digital signature.
    

Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE):

- PFS implementation using modular arithmetic.
    
- Ephemeral session keys prevent future server compromises from affecting recorded data.
    
- Even if one session's key is compromised, others remain confidential.
    
- Makes cryptanalysis of the entire "conversation" much harder.
    

Elliptic Curve DHE (ECDHE):

- More common implementation of PFS now.
    

#### Salting and Key stretching

- Entropy and Key Generation: The strength of cryptographic keys relies on their randomness (entropy). User-generated passwords often lack sufficient entropy.
    
- Salting: A technique to enhance password security by adding a random value (salt) to the password before hashing. This makes precomputed rainbow tables ineffective.
    
- Key Stretching: A process that strengthens weak keys by repeatedly hashing them with additional input (like a salt). This makes brute-force attacks much slower and computationally expensive.
    
- Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2): A widely used algorithm for key stretching, particularly in WPA security.
    

  

#### Blockchain 

- Structure: A blockchain is a growing list of records (blocks) linked together with cryptography. Each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a hash of the previous block.
    
- Security: The chaining of blocks ensures data integrity. Any change to a block invalidates subsequent blocks, making tampering evident.
    
- Decentralization: Blockchains are distributed across a peer-to-peer network, eliminating single points of failure and promoting trust.
    
- Transparency: Transactions are publicly viewable, enhancing accountability and reducing fraud.
    
- Applications: Blockchain technology has potential in various fields, including finance, legal, copyright, voting, identity management, and data storage.
    

#### Obfuscation

Obfuscation: The practice of making data or messages difficult to understand or discover.

Steganography: Hiding information within another file or medium (covertext). It can provide confidentiality, integrity, or non-repudiation.

Data Masking: Redacting sensitive data by replacing it with placeholder characters (e.g., "x") or preserving the format while obscuring the actual values. Used for de-identification.

Tokenization: Replacing sensitive data with random tokens, storing the original values separately in a token vault. Reversible, used as an alternative to encryption due to regulatory considerations.

De-identification: The process of obfuscating personal data to protect privacy while allowing data sharing.
