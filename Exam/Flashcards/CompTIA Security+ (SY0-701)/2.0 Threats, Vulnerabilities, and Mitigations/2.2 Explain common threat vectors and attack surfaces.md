<!--ID: 1722692634156-->


What is the goal of minimizing an attack surface? #flashcard
To restrict access and reduce opportunities for exploitation, thus enhancing security.
<!--ID: 1722692634168-->


What are the three key aspects to consider when assessing an attack surface? #flashcard

1.Scope
2.Threat Actor
3.Threat Vectors
<!--ID: 1722692634177-->


True or False: A threat vector and an attack vector are always the same thing. #flashcard
False (They can be used interchangeably, but attack vector can also refer to a successfully exploited vulnerability)
<!--ID: 1722692634186-->

What is a software vulnerability? #flashcard
A flaw in code or design that can be exploited to bypass security or crash the software.
<!--ID: 1722692884385-->


True or False: Most software is free from vulnerabilities. #flashcard
False
<!--ID: 1722692884395-->

A system that no longer receives updates or patches from the vendor.
<!--ID: 1722692884402-->


What is the purpose of isolating an unsupported application? #flashcard
To limit its exposure to potential threats and reduce the risk of exploitation.
<!--ID: 1722692884409-->

An attractive item or file designed to trick a user into opening a malicious payload.
<!--ID: 1722697287237-->


What is the purpose of a lure? #flashcard
To trick a user into facilitating an attack, often by triggering a software vulnerability.
<!--ID: 1722697287244-->

1.Removable devices
2.Executable files
2.Document files
4.Image files
<!--ID: 1722697287250-->

<!--ID: 1722697425070-->


What is a drive-by download? #flashcard 
A malicious download that occurs without user interaction, often when visiting a compromised website.
<!--ID: 1722697425078-->


What is the term for an exploit that triggers without any user interaction? #flashcard
